  -- Constructor application - Maybe Int, List a etc; as it should be always saturated tuple is a nobrainer
  -- Ok, this now gets tricky as we can have types dependent on values, so we can apply it not just to the type but to the literals etc
  -- E.g., if we have Vector a:U n:Int and we have a call to some calculation within the type:
  -- Vector Int (4+x) -- means we need to be able to parse expressions inside type applications
  | TApp Type [Type] -- due to the above, we may want to store BOTH types and expressions in ONE type. The only exception would be Arrows and Universe hierarchy?
  | TExpr Expr -- or this would resolve the issue above??? think through.

  -- so, should be OK, yes!
  | TArr Type Type -- Function sig - Maybe a -> String etc
  | TFunSig Record Type -- alternative way to store function signatures - {x1:t1, ..., xn:tn} -> Type. 
  -- ^^^ Might be BETTER for our purposes, as we want better documentation etc, and here we are storing variable names as additional information.

  | Universe Int -- for types, following the Martin-Lof theory - "Universe 0" is "small types", so regular types etc.
