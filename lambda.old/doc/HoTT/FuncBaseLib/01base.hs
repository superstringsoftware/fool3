-- Tuple / Record manipulations. Not sure if we'll want to expose them to the end users,
-- but they are very much needed for more efficient typeclass definitions.
-- Tuples are stored internally as {x1:t1, ..., xn:tn}
-- This is even more foundational than the List.
-- In pseudocode:

Record : Type = {
    {}  : Record {}; -- Empty record of type Record {}
    (:::) : Record = \field:{String, Type} rec:Record . {field, rec}
}

Basically, what we are saying is that there's an empty record {} and concatenation operator
::: that appends another record element to an already existing record. I.e.:
r1 = x1:t1 ::: {} is equal to r1 = {x1:t1}, while
r2 = x1:t1 ::: x2:t2 ::: {} is equal to {x1:t1, x2:t2}.

These operators are built-in, but thanks to them we can define record manipulation functions:
-}

recmap = \func:({String, Type}->{String, Type}) rec . {
    {}     -> {};
    r:::rs -> (func r):::(recmap func rs) 
} 
-- func has a weird type of converting one field to another field. Since we have dependent functions,
-- it should work for us quite well.
