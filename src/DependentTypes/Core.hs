-- Intermediate explicity typed IR
-- For now, we can't really represent records this way, or can we?
Person { name:String, age:Int } translates into something like:
\name:String. \age:Int. Person name string, i.e. named access field info is erased. Where do we store it?
E.g., a person writes:
p = Person "James" 23 -- and then
f p = p.name ++ show p.age -- which goes something like:
\p:Person. (++) (Person.name p) (show (Person.age p))
which means we need to create some sort of qualified function name that accesses record fields?
Or simply convert it to numbered accessor as in any anonymous pair?

What if we have something like:
data Widget = Box {x, y: Int, ...} | Point {x,y:Int, ...} - and we want a function
f :: Widget -> Int
f w = w.x * w.x
b = Box ...; p = Point ...
main = f b + f p -- what happens here??
\w:Widget. (*) (.x w) (.x w)
- we can't use numbered approach because what if x has completely different numeric representation in different Constructors?
so, .x here would be = Box.x for Box and Point.x for Point, so it's sort of an implicit pattern match

Ok, this is quite complicated, need to think it through.

Using fully qualified names is probably way to go, at least explore it, so when creating a record we automatically create
fully qualified accessor functions, e.g:
Widget.Box.x w:Box = n-th accessor
Widget.Point.x w:Point = k-th accessor
Widget.x w:Widget = case w of Box -> Widget.Box.x
                              Point -> Widget.Point.x

Something like that.

Refresher on lambdas.
Maybe a:
Just = \a:Type \x:a. x : Maybe a
Nothing = ()
Pair = \a:Type \b:Type \x:a \y:b . (x y) : Pair a b

It's all good, but how do we determine type of our lambdas???

In IR above:
Just = DLam (Id a TStar) (DLam (Id x (TVar a))  DApp (DVar x) ??? )
- we can substitute ??? to our type info, something like DType (TApp (TCon Maybe) (TVar a))
this way, we annotate types by the last Expression in application tree.

-- read a bunch of stuff in test.fool, it explains how we can do everything via tuples
-- and yes, we can do it via App, but lists are more convenient (maybe?) to manipulate than trees in this case
-- Name is a tag (constructor tag most often if it's applicable)
-- [Expr] is a tuple itself
-- Type is the type of the resulting tuple

-- Basically, Tuple without any lambdas inside is a term
-- And again, we can (probably) do it via App

Some examples:

Maybe a = Just a | Nothing translates to:
Lam (TyVar "a" KStar)
  Tuple "Maybe" [
    Lam (Id "x" (TVar "a")) (Tuple "Just" [VarId "x"] (TApp (TCon "Maybe") (TVar "a"))),
    Tuple "Nothing" [] (TApp (TCon "Maybe") (TVar "a"))
  ] (KArr KStar KStar)

Bool = True | False:
  Tuple "Bool" [
    Tuple "True" [] (TCon "Bool"),
    Tuple "False" [] (TCon "Bool")
  ] KStar

etc.
