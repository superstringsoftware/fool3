# named function calls:
# we want to have meaningful names for readability when calling functions, e.g.:

square height width = height * width;

# but then when calling (if it's a complex function with a lot of params), we may want to name the arguments!
# in haskell, we can create a record, but first - records suck in haskell, plus creating a separate type for each new function call is an overkill, so:

# square height = 7, width = 9

# "explicit variable binding" - think about the syntax. It will simply be desugared into regular lambda anyway.

# case statements
fact x
  | x == 0 -> 1
  | x > 0 -> x * fact (x-1);

cmd c
  | c == "list" -> list
  | c == "print" -> print
  | otherwise -> nothing;

# testing record access
st x = x.address.city.2;

# fmap f x
#  | cons x == Nothing -> Nothing
#  | cons x == Just    -> Just (f x.0)
